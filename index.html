                <h1>OneSquare for Foursquare</h1>
                <h2>A simple yet efficient tool for Foursquare focused on only one function: check-in.</h2>
                <h3> Why rebuild a tool? </h3>
                <p> Foursquare moved the check-in function to its Swarm app. Personally, I'm not
                quite satisfied with Swarm's check-in experience. When I want to confirm the place
                before check in, I have to take several steps to see the map and return to the
                check-in view. So I made this small tool to help me with the quick check-in.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>It shows a proper scaled map preview of the check-in place.
                    <em>(You can use 3D Touch if your device supported)</em>
                </li>
                <li>The venue list can be sorted by distance according to your current location.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> But why a footprint? </h3>
                <p>Personally, I use the check-in as a memo for the places I've been to. So as a
                one-person developed simple tool, a footprint is a good option for me :)</p>
