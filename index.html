                <h2>An efficient check-in tool using Foursquare service.</h2>
                <h3> Why rebuild a tool? </h3>
                <p> Foursquare moved the check-in function to its Swarm app. Personally, I'm not
                quite satisfied with Swarm's check-in experience. When I want to confirm the place
                before check in, I have to take several steps to see the map and return to the
                check-in view. So I made this small tool to help me with the quick check-in.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>It shows a proper scaled map preview of the check-in place.
                    <em>You can also quickly check it by showing the context menu(long press the item).</em>
                </li>
                <li>The venue list can be sorted by distance according to your current location.</li>
                <li>The check-in can be synchronized to your calendar if you prefer so.
                    <em><b>Just write an event to your calendar, no other accesses at all.</b></em>
                </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
